# AUTH-FLOW

## What is this?

This is a simple project created to learn more about authentication flows, authentication business rules, tokenization, role based content viewing. It also helped to understand more about server configuration and react framework on front-end.

Keys were intentionally left in the repository, in order to make testing easier, given tha they are not actually granting access to anything.
